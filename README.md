# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe, a classic game built with Python and Pygame library, but with an added challenge - an unbeatable AI player that uses the Minimax algorithm. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row on the 3x3 game board. The game ends when either player wins or there is a tie.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:**

   `git clone https://github.com/abbas-sabra/tictactoe`

2. **Install Pygame by running the following command:**

   `pip install pygame`

3. **Run the game using the following command:**

   `python runner.py`
   
## How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
Players take turns placing their symbols on the board.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
The game also includes an unbeatable AI player that uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move.
